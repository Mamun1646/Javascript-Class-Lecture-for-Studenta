//Javasript Operator Precedence
//Concept of Data Types
let length = 16;                               // Number
let lastName = "Johnson";                      // String
let x = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" };    // Object
// JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results:
let result = "Volvo" + 16 + 4; //Volvo164
let result2 = 16 + 4 + "Volvo"; //20Volvo
// JavaScript Types are Dynamic
// JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types:
let data;           // Now x is undefined
data= 5;           // Now x is a Number
data = "John";      // Now x is a String



//String define 
let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";   // Using double quotes
let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';   // Using single quotes

//javasript number
let x1 = 34.00;     // Written with decimals
let x2 = 34;        // Written without decimals
